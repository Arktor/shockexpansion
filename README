SHOCKEXPANSION

    Calculates drag force applied to a symmetrical airfoil in the supersonic
adiabatic flow at the zero angle-of-attack.
Physical model of the fluid is the ideal nonviscous gas without heat transfer.


METHOD DESCRIPTION

    The method used for drag calculation in this application is called
"shock-expansion". Its basic idea is that supersonic flow around an airfoil
can be represented with a system of shock waves and expansion waves.

    An airfoil is partitioned into a number of segments called "panels".
Flow on each panel is considered to be homogeneous and parallel to its surface.
If parameters of the flow on a certain panel are known, parameters of the flow
on the adjacent panel downstream can be calculated using equations of a shock
wave or expansion wave. Type of equations depends on relative slope of the panel
downstream. If its slope is larger than the one of the panel upstream, shock wave
equations are used, otherwise flow parameters are calculated using expansion wave
equations.

Application generates an output file ("out.dat") and writes solving process
log and calculation results into it.


LIMITATIONS

1. Airfoil geometry must be scaled to have its first node
   at (0.0, 0.0) and its last node at (1.0, 0.0); 
2. Since only symmetrical airfoil can be calculated, you should provide
   only its upper contour;
3. Too large relative slope values can lead for the flow to become subsonic
   or to separate, which will terminate the calculation.


TO DO

1. Improve application output and exception handling;
2. Optimize solving algorithm: improve accuracy and solving speed.
3. Add the ability to set angle-of-attack;
4. Add flow separation calculation for cases of very high speeds ang large
   slopes.
